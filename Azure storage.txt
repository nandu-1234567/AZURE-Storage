 Azure Storage services:
     * Azure Storage includes core services for different data types:
     * Azure Blob Storage: For unstructured data like images and videos, supporting Data Lake Storage and tiered storage.
     * Azure Files: Managed cloud file shares accessible via SMB and NFS, suitable for migrating file servers.
     * Azure Disk Storage: High-performance block storage for Azure VMs.
     * Azure Queues: A messaging store for asynchronous messaging.
     * Azure Tables: A NoSQL key-attribute store for structured data, now part of Azure Cosmos DB. 
  
 Data Replication :
     * Data replication is the process of creating and maintaining multiple identical copies of data across different locations or systems. It's a fundamental strategy        for ensuring data availability, fault tolerance, and disaster recovery.
     * Synchronous :  Requires immediate response or sequential execution where one action must be completed before the next can begin.
     * Asynchronous : Interactions or operations that don't require an immediate response or sequential execution, allowing tasks to run independently.
 High Availability :
     * High availability focuses on preventing downtime due to localized failures or disruptions within a single data center or a set of closely linked cloud               Availability Zones.
 Disaster Recovery:
     *Disaster recovery (DR) is like having a well-rehearsed plan for when things go seriously wrong with your computer systems and data.
Azure Managed Disks:
     * Azure Managed Disks are block-level storage volumes that simplify disk management for Azure Virtual Machines (VMs) and Azure VMware Solution.
     * Premium SSDs: High-performance SSD-based storage for I/O-intensive workloads, providing high throughput and low latency, suitable for production applications        and databases.
     * Standard SSDs: Offer a balanced approach between performance and cost, delivering lower latency and higher reliability than Standard HDDs, suitable for web        servers, lightly used enterprise applications, and dev/test environments.
     * Standard HDDs: Cost-effective storage optimized for applications requiring large amounts of storage with low IOPS, ideal for backup, archives, and non-critical        workloads. 
     * Ultra Disks: The highest-performing option, offering the best performance with sub-millisecond latency and high IOPS and throughput, ideal for demanding        workloads like SAP HANA and top-tier databases
